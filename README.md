## Features

- **Technology Stack:** Developed with Microservices and Spring Boot ensuring robust performance and scalability.
- **Notable Featutre:** You can search for all ratings by a specific user, which indicates all the hotels that have been rated by that specific user. Additionally, you can also search for hotel ratings by all users, providing information about how a hotel has been rated by all users.
- **Secure Authentication:** Implemented OAuth 2.0 API, which stands for “Open Authorization”, is a standard designed to allow a website or application to access resources hosted by other web apps on behalf of a user.
- **Enhanced Security:** I am not storing user credentials in the database as I have implemented OAuth 2.0.
- **Access Control:** Restricts access to the API to registered users only.
- **Error Handling:** Develop comprehensive error handling for the API, covering scenarios like invalid input, trying to access services by unautherised user etc.
